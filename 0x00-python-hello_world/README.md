This directory tests understanding of Python introductory basics:
- Using the Python interpreter
- String formatters in python3
1. **0-run** - shell script that runs a Python script. The name of the Python script is saved in an environment variable `$PYFILE`.
2. **1-run_inline** - shell script that runs a Python code. The code is stored in an environment variable `$PYCODE`.
3. **2-print.py** - Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.
4. **3-print_number.py** - Python code that prints the integer stored in the variable `number` using f strings and without casting the variable `number` into the string, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
5. **4-print_float.py** - Python code that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits. F strings is used and `number` isn't cast directly into the string.
6. **5-print_string.py** - Python code that prints 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.
7. **6-concat.py** - Python code that prints `Welcome to Holberton School!`.
8. **7-edges.py** - Python code that has the following conditions met:
   - `word_first_3` contains the first 3 letters of the variable `word`.
   - `word_last_2` contains the last 2 letters of the variable `word`.
   - `middle_word` contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters
9. **8-concat_edges.py** - Python code that prints `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.
10. **9-easter_egg.py** - Python script that prints `The Zen of Python`, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
11. **10-check_cycle.c** - `C` function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. It returns 1 if there's a cycle and 0 if there isn't.
