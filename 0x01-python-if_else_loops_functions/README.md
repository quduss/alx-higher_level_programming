- functions
1. **0-positive_or_negative.py** - `Python` code that prints either `positive`, `negative`, or `zero` depending on the random value stored inside variable `number`.
2. **1-last_digit.py** - `Python` code that prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
3. **2-print_alphabet.py** - `Python` program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. **3-print_alphabt.py** - `Python` program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. letters `e` and `q` are not printed.
5. **4-print_hexa.py** - `Python` program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
6. **5-print_comb2.py** - `Python` program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. Numbers are separated with a `, ` and are in ascending order with two digits.
7. **6-print_comb3.py** - `Python` program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers are separated with a `, ` and are in ascending order with two digits. The two digits are different.
8. **7-islower.py** - `Python` function that checks for lowercase character using `ord()`.
9. **8-uppercase.py** - `Python` function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line using `ord()`.
10. **9-print_last_digit.py** - Python function that prints the last digit of a number.
11. **10-add.py** - `Python` function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. **11-pow.py** - `Python` function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.
13. **12-fizzbuzz.py** - FizzBuzz function in `python`.
14. **13-insert_number.c** - `C` function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
